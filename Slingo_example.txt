Hi welcome to Slingo Help!

Game Objective:

The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible in 15 rounds. 
The player earns points by spinning matching values to those on their Slingo 
board. Ultimately, the player will earn the most points by filling up the 
Slingo board.

How to earn points:

The player earns 5 points for each individual value they spin that matches
a value on the board. The player will also earn 100 points for obtaining Slingo. 
That means they have hit 5 values in a row, in a column, or diagonally. Finally, 
a player will earn 1000 points if they successfully fill up their entire Slingo 
board. 

Wild cards:

The player has a small chance of spinning 3 different wildcards in the game. The
first is a "Double Points" wildcard meaning that for that round whichever numbers
they match on their boards, those points will be doubled. Next, the "Free Space"
wildcard gives the player a random free space even if they did not roll that 
number. Finally, the player can roll a "Lose Points" wildcard. This wildcard takes 
a random number of points off of the player's score. 

Be careful!
    Rolling a Lose Points and a Double Points at the same time make you lose 
    double the points!
